Building a hypothetical narrative to make it more relatable and engaging isn't goint to cut. It’s a valid and widely used approach, especially in today’s DSA learning landscape, where analogies and real-life examples are often incorporated to aid understanding.

However, in my experience, such storytelling can sometimes box students into a limited interpretation of the concept. While analogies and examples are useful, they should serve as supporting tools — not the core of the explanation.

Our primary goal should be to convey the essence of the concept in a way that empowers the student to think independently. After watching the video, I don’t just want them to feel, “I learned something new today.” I want them to think, “I could have arrived at this solution myself if I had thought about it the right way — this content helped guide me toward that thinking.”

This is where most DSA courses fall short. They often focus heavily on the “how” — how a solution works — but neglect the “why”: why it works, why it's better, and how one might arrive at it organically. This lack of deeper insight makes it harder for students to retain the knowledge or apply it effectively in new contexts.

I’ve noticed that while students may grasp concepts during instruction, they often struggle during implementation. They fail to recognize familiar patterns when faced with actual problems — not because they didn’t learn, but because the understanding wasn’t internalized in a way that supports real problem-solving.
