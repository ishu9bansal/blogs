🚀 **What if I told you Binary Search isn’t just an algorithm… but a way to think?**

If you're a beginner or someone who has “learned” binary search but never *really* felt it click — this is for you.

Over the next 6 days, I’m breaking down **Binary Search** like never before:
🔍 What does it mean to *search* in a computer?
📚 Why searching in an *ordered world* is a superpower.
⚖️ How *parity* and the *right question* transform your data.
🧠 When search becomes *problem solving*, not just locating.
🎯 Real-life analogies, games, and visual insights — no jargon, no confusion.

Whether you're just starting out in programming or brushing up your fundamentals, follow along. You might never look at algorithms the same way again.

**Day 1 drops tomorrow. Stay tuned.**
