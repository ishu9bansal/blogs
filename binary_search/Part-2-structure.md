We have already discussed searching in unstructured data. Now, let’s think about what happens when the data is structured — specifically, when it is sorted based on some property.

For example, consider student records that include roll numbers. If the records are sorted by roll number or alphabetically by name, then that structure gives us a significant advantage when searching. Let’s assume the data is sorted by roll number. In that case, finding a record with a specific roll number becomes easier than searching randomly.

How is it easier? Suppose the roll numbers range from 1001 to 1050 — so there are 50 students. Now imagine we want to find the record with roll number 1045. Since we know the data is sorted, we can immediately guess that this number will be toward the end of the list. So instead of starting from the beginning, we can start searching from the end. This reduces the number of elements we need to look at.

The key point is that the order or structure of data gives us an advantage. It allows us to design more efficient algorithms. This is where *data structures* and *algorithms* come into play. If we store data in a certain structure, then some algorithms can perform specific operations (like search) much more efficiently than others.

So, if we know the structure of the data, we can choose or design an algorithm that optimizes for that structure. This leads to faster and more efficient searches.

We'll soon talk about **binary search**, which is an algorithm designed to search efficiently in sorted (ordered) data. For now, just remember: knowing the structure of data helps us reduce the search space. A smaller search space means fewer comparisons and faster results.

This is how we progress from basic linear search — which checks each element one by one — to more optimized search algorithms like binary search.
