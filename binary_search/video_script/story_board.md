### 🎞️ **Visual Storyboard: “What Is Search? (And How Computers Actually Do It)”**

---

#### **Scene 1: Opening Hook \[0:00–0:10]**

* **Visual**: Animated character (or host) looking around in a messy room, searching for their phone.
* **On-screen text**: “What does it mean to *search*?”
* **Narration**:
  *“What does it really mean to search for something?”*

---

#### **Scene 2: Human Search Examples \[0:10–0:30]**

* **Visual**: Split-screen showing:

  * A sighted person spotting a red book on a shelf.
  * A blind person using touch or a cane to navigate.
* **On-screen labels**: “Sighted search” vs. “Tactile search”
* **Narration**:
  *“For humans, it can be visual, tactile, even intuitive—but it depends on our abilities and environment.”*

---

#### **Scene 3: Transition to Computers \[0:30–0:40]**

* **Visual**: Zoom into a computer screen—transition from human world to digital bits.
* **On-screen text**: “How do computers search?”
* **Narration**:
  *“But for computers, things are very different.”*

---

#### **Scene 4: Binary World \[0:40–0:55]**

* **Visual**: Matrix-style animation of 1s and 0s flowing across the screen.
* **On-screen text**: “Everything is 0s and 1s”
* **Narration**:
  *“In their world, everything is just 0s and 1s—bits and bytes.”*

---

#### **Scene 5: Key Definitions \[0:55–1:15]**

* **Visual**: Animated chalkboard or cards for terms.
* **On-screen text**:

  * “Search Space = Where we’re looking”
  * “Target = What we’re trying to find”
  * “Algorithm = How we look for it”
* **Narration**:
  *“To make sense of it, let’s define three things: the search space, the target, and the algorithm.”*

---

#### **Scene 6: Memory Visualization \[1:15–1:40]**

* **Visual**: Horizontal line of boxes labeled as “bytes” with addresses: 0, 4, 8, 12…
* **On-screen text**: “Memory: Sequence of bytes with addresses”
* **Narration**:
  *“Computer memory is like a row of boxes—each holding a fixed chunk of data, each with its own address.”*

---

#### **Scene 7: How Data Is Accessed \[1:40–2:00]**

* **Visual**: Animation showing a pointer jumping from address to address, skipping by fixed steps.
* **On-screen text**: “Jump by size to reach next element”
* **Narration**:
  *“Because of fixed sizes, the computer knows exactly how far to jump to reach the next item.”*

---

#### **Scene 8: Linear Search Simulation \[2:00–2:40]**

* **Visual**: A loop running over a sequence of numbers in memory, checking one-by-one, highlighting when a match is found.
* **On-screen text**: “Linear Search”
* **Narration**:
  *“So, a basic search starts from the beginning… checks each item one by one… until it finds the target—or reaches the end.”*

---

#### **Scene 9: Emphasizing Dumb Computers \[2:40–2:55]**

* **Visual**: Funny animation of a robot continuing past the end of the list, bumping into a wall.
* **On-screen text**: “Computers need explicit instructions!”
* **Narration**:
  *“And remember—computers don’t know when to stop unless we tell them!”*

---

#### **Scene 10: Summary of Linear Search \[2:55–3:10]**

* **Visual**: Recap graphic:

  * Memory ➝ Loop ➝ Target Found ➝ Return Address
* **On-screen text**: “Linear Search: Simple but Slow”
* **Narration**:
  *“This method is called Linear Search. It’s simple, but not the most efficient.”*

---

#### **Scene 11: Tease Future Topics \[3:10–3:30]**

* **Visual**: Animation zooming out to show Binary Search Tree, Hash Table, Indexes.
* **On-screen text**: “Coming up: Faster, Smarter Searches”
* **Narration**:
  *“Now that we’ve nailed the basics, we’re ready to explore faster, smarter ways to search—like Binary Search and Hashing!”*

---

#### **Scene 12: Outro \[3:30–3:45]**

* **Visual**: Host or animated character waving goodbye.
* **On-screen text**: “Like 👍 | Subscribe 🔔 | Comment 💬”
* **Narration**:
  *“Hit like if you learned something new, and subscribe so you don’t miss the next deep dive into the world of algorithms!”*
