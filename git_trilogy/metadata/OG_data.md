💾 **Commit Like a Pro — The Art of Saving Progress and Staying Sane**
*(Part II of “The Developer’s Time Machine” Trilogy)*

Every line of code tells a story — but only if you record it well.
A messy commit history can make debugging feel like archaeology… while clean commits turn your project into a time machine.

In this second part of the trilogy, I’ve broken down:
👉 What makes a *good commit*
👉 When (and how often) to commit
👉 How to handle conflicts, stashes, and merge chaos

It’s less about Git commands — and more about *thinking like a developer who values clarity and history.*

If you’ve ever wondered *“what’s the right commit size?”* or *“how do I write commit messages people actually read?”* — this one’s for you.
